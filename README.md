# ðŸ“Š SmartPortfolio

This repository contains the early planning documents for **SmartPortfolio**, a web and mobile application aimed at helping private investors optimize their stock portfolios.

See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the detailed vision statement in both Danish and English.

## Overview

SmartPortfolio is intended to:

- Provide an easy-to-understand portfolio overview
- Offer buy/sell recommendations based on data and user preferences
- Support partially invested portfolios with a cash buffer
- Let users simulate changes before approving them

This project is currently in the planning phase. More documentation and implementation details will follow as development progresses.

## GUI Concept

A simple user interface could include:

1. **Dashboard** â€“ overview of total portfolio value, cash balance, and recent activity.
2. **Recommendations** â€“ clear list of buy/sell suggestions with short explanations.
3. **Simulation mode** â€“ preview the effect of potential trades before approving them.
4. **Portfolio history** â€“ charts of performance compared to benchmarks.
5. **Settings** â€“ personal preferences for risk level, sectors, and notification frequency.
